	abstract = {News framing plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and understanding of events. Traditional news frame analysis relies heavily on manual annotation, which is timeconsuming and labor-intensive. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based method for automatic news frame identification (ANFI). By leveraging a pre-trained Transformer encoder and frame-specific semantic features, ANFI captures the latent semantic structures of news text. It then classifies the text into one of the seven commonly used generic frames: Fact, Conflict, Responsibility, Economic Consequences, Human Interest, Morality, and Leadership. Experimental results on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in identifying news frames automatically. The ANFI model achieves high accuracy and outperforms traditional machine learning baselines. This research provides a new perspective on the application of deep learning techniques in computational journalism and facilitates large-scale news frame analysis.},

Zhang et al. (2024) propose a novel deep learning model (ANFI) that automates news frame identification, categorizing texts into seven generic frames: Fact, Conflict, Responsibility, Economic Consequences, Human Interest, Morality, and Leadership. Utilizing a Transformer-based architecture, ANFI leverages semantic representations from pre-trained language models (BERT) combined with frame-specific semantic features, significantly outperforming traditional methods. The method achieves high accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating strong potential for analyzing large-scale news datasets.

Evaluation:
This paper is directly relevant to my methodology, as it presents a master deep learning approach to automatically detect and classify media frames, aligning with my approach. The model’s integration of pre-trained language models and semantic features enhances both accuracy and interpretability, addressing a key methodological challenge in computational framing analysis. However, while the paper emphasizes generic frames, my work extends through examining frames specific to nationalist narratives and comparisons across political spectra.

We retrieved 15 national polls on perceptions of “China threat” together with 30,795 China-related news articles published before each poll. Media discourse related to “China threat” was coded into ideological, military, and economic second-level agendas using computational methods. We ﬁrst tracked how “China threat” waxed and waned in media discourse over this period. Second, we examined whether the salience of “China threat” in the media has agenda-setting effects on public opinion. We found the economic threat agenda is correlated with the American public perception of China’s threat at a marginally signiﬁcant level and is signiﬁcantly correlated with the Democrats’ threat perception.},

Zheng et al. (2024) conduct a large-scale computational content analysis of U.S. media coverage (1999–2019) to examine how the “China threat” narrative evolved across economic, military, and ideological dimensions. They found a significant increase in the economic threat narrative, particularly after the year 2008, and documented how media portrayals correlated with shifts in American public opinion—especially economic concerns resonating strongly with Democratic respondents. Using advanced machine learning techniques (BERT), the authors demonstrate how implicit threat narratives (beyond explicit mentions) significantly shape public perceptions of China.

Evaluation:
This paper is particularly valuable to my project for its robust methodological integration of computational text analysis (BERT), effectively capturing subtle shifts in nationalist narratives over time. It clearly establish an agenda-setting link between media framing of economic threats and public opinion, specifically highlighting partisan divides. I will expand by comparing similar threat framing in relation to multiple geopolitical rivals (notably Russia alongside China) and systematically examining differences between left- and right-leaning U.S. media.

Golan and Lukito (2015) analyze how two elite American newspapers—the New York Times (NYT) and the Wall Street Journal (WSJ)—frame China’s emergence as a global power through opinion articles. Their textual analysis identifies significant differences: NYT tends to portray China primarily as an economic partner with structural limitations and internal sociopolitical problems, emphasizing cooperation over rivalry. In contrast, WSJ frames China as a direct geopolitical and economic threat to U.S. interests, employing aggressive rhetoric and emphasizing China’s nationalist ambitions and illegal economic activities, such as intellectual-property theft. Both newspapers’ framing aligns broadly with U.S. government narratives and policies towards China, reflecting underlying political and ideological biases.

Evaluation:
This article is directly relevant to my research as it clearly demonstrates the partisan differences in U.S. media framing of nationalism, particularly regarding China’s global role. Its qualitative, inductive textual analysis can be a complement to my computational approach with a much richer insights into media framing strategies.

	abstract = {The emergence of social media as news sources has added another layer to news framing research. This study analyzes U.S. news coverage about China in the COVID19 pandemic—an important issue because of the recently rising xenophobia and racism toward Asians—to explore how publishing platforms influence partisan framing in digital news. By conducting structural topic modeling (STM) analyses on website news and news tweets published by 27 major U.S. news media, this study examines how framing varied across media with different political orientations and whether publishing platforms moderate framing strategies. The results show support for differences across the spectrum of political orientation and between the two platforms. Conservative media tend to adopt more sensational and attitudinal frames compared to media that are more liberal. The gap between the two sides of the political spectrum was in general wider on Twitter than on news websites. Implications on media effects studies and activism against hate crimes are discussed.},

Zhang and Trifiro (2022) analyze the partisan framing in U.S. digital news and social media (Twitter) coverage about China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using structural topic modeling (STM) across 27 major U.S. media outlets, they find clear partisan differences: conservative outlets utilized more sensational and negative frames linking China explicitly to blame, misinformation, and conspiracy theories, while liberal media adopted broader, less confrontational frames. The study highlights significant differences in framing strategies between traditional media and social media like Twitter, with the latter amplifying polarization and sensationalism due to platform policy.

Evaluation:
This paper is highly relevant to my topic with innovative methodological use of STM to measure partisan framing. Its insights on cross-platform differences directly enlighten my research questions about political spectrum and media channels. For my research, I can extend this analysis by explicitly comparing nationalist framings related to multiple geopolitical rivals (China and Russia) across broader geopolitical contexts, rather than focusing solely on a singular topic. It provides important empirical support for my methodological approach, as well as underscore the critical role of platform differences in amplifying nationalist framing.

A comparative quantitative and qualitative analysis of official U.S. communications and U.S. partisan media coverage in the first week of the invasion aims to uncover how the U.S. government set the agenda and framed the events, and to what extent the media copied or diverged from this agenda-setting and framing. The results suggest a narrow focus and distinct framing on the part of the U.S. government, partly taken over by partisan media. The latter also touched on other topics that fit media logic and provided some counter-frames in line with their ideological positions, yet overall confirmed the dominant framing of the war as unjust, unprovoked and premeditated, as Putin’s choice, and the position of the U.S. as the leader of the free world and defender of democracy.},

Hyzen and Van den Bulck analyze U.S. propaganda strategies during the initial week of the Russia–Ukraine war. They assess how the U.S. government and partisan media set agendas and framed the conflict. They highlight a dominant narrative framing Russia’s invasion as “unjustified, unprovoked, and premeditated,” clearly attributing blame to Putin personally. The authors identify that this messaging actually reinforced U.S. identity as a defender of global democracy, employing historical Cold War rhetoric contrasting freedom and democracy (U.S.) against authoritarian aggression (Russia). Partisan media adopted core elements of this framing while introducing counter-frames on specific domestic policy issues, like energy sanctions.

Evaluation:
This paper is highly relevant for my topic, as it directly addresses how U.S. government and partisan media narratives frame nationalism through contrasting portrayals of Russia. Its detailed analysis of framing techniques is inspiring for my methodological approach, particularly through its integration of quantitative and qualitative content analysis. Notably, the paper emphasizes media alignment with official narratives, a dimension I will expand by explicitly comparing left- and right-leaning media frames. I will investigate framing consistency over a longer period and across diverse geopolitical contexts, not just immediate responses during the crisis events.

Despite rapprochement under President Dmitry Medvedev, the media image of Russia has been overwhelmingly negative since 2008. Negative media editorial opinions of Russia reflect fears of autocratic political systems that are represented as a dangerous mirror image of the American system. To maintain this binary, aspects of Russian politics that did not fit into the neo-Soviet autocracy narrative were ignored. An original contribution of the article is its identification of key frames used by leading American media outlets to construct a narrative about contemporary Russia as a neo-Soviet autocracy. It demonstrates that this narrative is instrumental in confirming domestic perceptions of American national identity that emphasize its association with freedom at home and leadership of the ‘free world’ abroad.

Tsygankov examines how leading American newspapers framed Russia between 2008 and 2014, revealing a consistent portrayal of Russia as a “neo-Soviet autocracy.” It shows that U.S. media primarily employed negative frames, often using historical analogies to the Soviet Union to highlight its fixed authoritarian tendencies, corruption, repression, and militaristic aggression. Tsygankov argues these portrayals serve to reinforce American national identity by defining it in opposition to Russia’s authoritarianism. Even during periods of potential improvement in U.S.-Russia relations, American media continued to depict Russia negatively, with a particular emphasis on the personalized role of Putin as an authoritarian figure. 

Evaluation:
This article provides strong evidence of American media employing consistent nationalist framing strategies, directly relevant to my exploration of American nationalism and Russian nationalism. Tsygankov’s methodology, combining textual analysis of newspaper editorials with quantitative coding of sentiment, effectively highlights media bias and narrative consistency. My project will expand on this by incorporating computational techniques to analyze large-scale media framing, potentially uncovering more detailed shifts or divergences within political spectrum that Tsygankov unified negative portrayal fails to uncover.

Here, we draw on two concepts from the political science literature to explore subtler strategies for government media manipulation: agenda-setting (selecting what topics to cover) and framing (deciding how topics are covered). We analyze 13 years (100K articles) of the Russian newspaper Izvestia and identify a strategy of distraction: articles mention the U.S. more frequently in the month directly following an economic downturn in Russia. We introduce embedding-based methods for cross-lingually projecting English frames to Russian, and discover that these articles emphasize U.S. moral failings and threats to the U.S. Our work oﬀers new ways to identify subtle media manipulation strategies at the intersection of agenda-setting and framing.},

Field et al. (2018) analyze the media manipulation strategies in Russian news, specifically focusing on agenda-setting (what topics are emphasized) and framing (how those topics are portrayed). Using computational methods on a sample of over 100,000 Russian articles from Izvestia, they find a significant pattern of “distraction,” where economic downturns in Russia predict increased negative coverage of the United States. By leveraging embedding-based methods and cross-lingual projection, the authors identify dominant frames highlighting moral failings, security threats, and criticisms of the U.S. This strategy positions external adversaries negatively during domestic crises, thereby reinforcing national identity through implicit opposition.

Evaluation:
This paper provides a robust methodological example relevant to my project by demonstrating how computational tools (embedding-based, cross-lingual approaches) can effectively analyze nationalist frames across different languages. Its innovative use of economic indicators (Granger-causality tests) to identify subtle forms of state-driven media manipulation is notable. However, while Field et al. focus primarily on external distraction as a manipulation strategy, my work will extend this insight by directly comparing framing strategies used by different political leanings within U.S. media. My analysis complements this study by assessing how similar nationalist frames might differ across political spectra.

Speakman and Funk analyze the framing strategies used in mainstream and far-right conservative podcasts, focusing on the concept of "nationalism" and related themes like race, immigration, and conspiracy theories.

Both mainstream and extremist podcasts employ nationalism and anti-immigrant rhetoric as core organizing principles, though mainstream shows moderate their language to maintain broader acceptability. The paper illustrates how nationalist rhetoric serves to construct social worlds among conservative audiences, framing them as under threat from external and internal 'others.'
