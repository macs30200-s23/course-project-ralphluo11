# Framing the Nation: Media Construction of National Identity

##  Project Description

This project analyzes how major U.S. news outlets construct and contrast American nationalism with Chinese and Russian nationalism. Using a hybrid NLP framework combining LDA, SBERT+UMAP+KMeans, and BERT-based classification, the analysis maps identity frames (e.g., ‚Äúgeopolitical influence,‚Äù ‚Äústate governance‚Äù) and tracks shifts in sentiment and stance across 50,000+ articles from 2021‚Äì2024.

Key themes include:
- **Media framing divergence by outlet and political orientation**
- **Temporal shifts in identity frames tied to geopolitical events**
- **Stance-sentiment mismatches revealing framing complexity**

Initial results from NYT 2024 articles show dominant use of strategic and governance frames, with sentiment and stance diverging on emotionally loaded frames like "dictatorship."

##  Code Structure & Key Steps

The notebook `mock.ipynb` executes the full pipeline including the following steps:

###  Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset: `China_article_nyt2024.csv`
- Check and relabel unknown `news_desk` values as 'Multimedia'
- Drop articles missing `full_text`
- Filter out low-frequency `news_desk` groups (fewer than 10 articles)
- Parse and format `pub_date` column

###  Topic Modeling
- Apply LDA to discover latent topics
- Interpret and manually assign identity labels
- Extract topic distributions using `lda.transform()`

### Identity Mapping
- Define `identity_map = {...}` to assign topics to identity dimensions
- Count and visualize identity occurrences with `value_counts()`
- Generate correlation heatmaps for frame co-occurrence

###  Clustering and Semantic Anchoring
- SBERT embedding ‚Üí UMAP reduction ‚Üí KMeans clustering
- Align cluster centroids with anchor phrases using cosine similarity
- Refine visualizations by merging similar clusters

###  Sentiment and Stance Analysis
- Perform VADER sentiment scoring on `full_text`
- Visualize sentiment per identity frame using box plots and line charts
- Apply stance detection via GPT-labeled training data and keyword rules
- Plot sentiment vs. frame share over time
